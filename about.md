I’m Olu (Niyi-Awosusi). I live in London. I’ve been in love with the internet ever since I installed dial-up on the family computer, back when NTL was still a thing and it timed out every 15 minutes!

I like social enterprises, social networks and Socrates. Oh, and the rule of three. I was a student at [Founders and Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/), a free 16 week full time coding bootcamp that teaches Javascript, Node, D3 and Hapi last time I checked.

I also learnt digital skills like SEO, social media management and design from the wonderful team at [Fluency](http://www.fluency.io/).

I’m currently looking for work as a junior front-end web developer. I also want to get involved in FOSS and online community management.

Drop me a line on twitter, I am @oluoluoxenfree on most things!
