I’m Olu. I live in London. I'm a frontend developer who adores Javascript-based technologies, HTML, CSS, accessible websites, writing/speaking/listening/reading, bubble tea, [Bee and Puppycat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dop4MTlf_zc), lists, plantain, planning/scheming, unnecessary amounts of punctuation (!!!) and personal organisation/growth/finance/development.

I’ve been in love with the internet ever since I installed dial-up on the family computer, back when Virgin Media was NTL and it timed out every 15 minutes! I believe that the internet is something that should be available and accessible to every and anyone who wants to use it. [It has changed my life in innumerable ways](https://www.opentagclosetag.com/tech-inspiration/).

I like social enterprises, social networks and Socrates. Oh, and the rule of three. I was a student at [Founders and Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/), a 16-week full-time coding bootcamp.

I've given talks at [Afrotech Fest](https://www.afrotechfest.co.uk/) and [Non-Binary in Tech](https://twitter.com/nonbinarytech?lang=en), about [web accessibility](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16HG9EyOJG9kBYPXhulq7hjgOXz7B5PjuCwCbXdcorCM/edit) and [community](https://slides.com/oluoluoxenfree/beyond-ones-and-zeroes#/).

Drop me a line on twitter, I am @oluoluoxenfree on most things!
