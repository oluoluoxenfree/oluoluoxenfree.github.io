I’m Olu (Niyi-Awosusi), 23 and living in London. I’ve been in love with the internet ever since I installed dial-up on the family computer, back when NTL was still a thing and it timed out every 15 minutes!

I like social enterprises, social networks and Socrates. Oh, and the rule of three. I was a student at Founders and Coders, a free 16 week full time coding bootcamp that teaches Javascript, Node, D3 and Hapi last time I checked.

I also learnt digital skills like SEO, social media management and design from the wonderful team at Fluency.

I’m currently looking for work as a front-end web developer. I also want to get involved in FOSS and online community management.

I'm currently looking for work in London.

Drop me a line on twitter, I am @oluoluoxenfree on most things!
