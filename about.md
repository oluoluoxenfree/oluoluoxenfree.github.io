I’m Olu (Niyi-Awosusi), currently 22 and living in London. I’ve been in love with the internet ever since I installed dial-up on the family computer, back when NTL was still a thing and it timed out every 15 minutes!

I like social enterprises, social networks and Socrates. Oh, and the rule of three. I’m currently a student at Founders and Coders, a free 16 week full time coding bootcamp that teaches Javascript, node, d3 and other lovely Javascript flavoured technologies.

I’m also learning digital skills like SEO, social media management and design from the wonderful team at Fluency through their course Get Digital.

I’m doing all of this in the hopes of becoming a full stack web developer.

Drop me a line on twitter, I am @oluoluoxenfree on most things!
