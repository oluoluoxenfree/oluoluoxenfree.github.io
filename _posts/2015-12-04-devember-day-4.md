Flip flop on the way I'm going to implement this, as it seems [CORS](https://www.maxcdn.com/one/visual-glossary/cors/) prevents any way of interacting with the Twitter API in the browser side. I was fairly sure this was true already given [my hacky way](https://github.com/oluoluoxenfree/oluoluoxenfree.github.io/blob/master/js/app.js) of getting the github contribution graph to show up on my project page.

I also couldn't get the TCP socket suggestion to work, given that Chrome apparently took steps towards separating chrome apps and chrome extensions a bit more robustly, and there's now no API to do it. So now I'm wondering whether it's worth doing this app, as it may be a bit too similar to lorem blankum skills wise, even though I'd have to use authentication, some form of audio API and hopefully an animation of some sort.

I was told by a friend they weren't too similar so I've started the app using node, hapi, gulp, sass and the npm twitter module as usual. A bit uninspired colour pallete and design wise so I'll give that a think tomorrow, I can think of the animations I want to use and how I want it to look user journey wise at least.

Barely scraped an hour today which is bad, but been feeling run down all of today and made a bit of starting headway at least! Also learnt a lot in the process of doing this, like chaning my deprecated `gulp.run()` command.

I'm going to work on the Free Code Camp projects as my 'fallback' project in case I get stuck and am waiting for a reply on something related to this. I think working on two things I have to work a lot out for at the same time probably isn't the best move.

What have you been working on? Have you learnt something new recently? Let me know in the comments.
