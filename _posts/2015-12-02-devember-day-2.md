##Day 2:

After reading [this post](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/7-good-developer-habits-wish-id-developed-sooner?cid=4902&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_content=blog-post&utm_campaign=social-nov-2015) I decided that my focus for the next day would be [Javascripthers website](http://javascripthers.github.io/) ([github](https://github.com/javascripthers/javascripthers.github.io)) and [Twitter Windchimes](https://github.com/oluoluoxenfree/twitter_windchimes). I'm going to use Jekyll for the Javascripthers site so it'll be things like faffing over layout and content that make it take time.

Twitter Windchimes will be a browser extension that plays a tune every time one of five keywords that you pick is tweeted on Twitter. I'd love to also make a standalone version to practice authentication and SVG or CSS or HTML5 canvas animation, but that's a goal for another day.

For a while I was still trying to decide whether I wanted Windchimes to be a standalone thing or a browser extension. After consulting with a friend they said it would probably be best to start off with a browser extension. I got a bit confused about how I could make this work without a backend but another friend suggested that I use a TCP socket, so I'll research what that is tomorrow. Most of my coding today was faffing with the Javascripthers site and I didn't even get very far, I was stuck on design. I'm going to keep it quite clean and simple and try to use the official Javascript symbol colours.

[Wakatime](https://wakatime.com) tells me I didn't quite make an hour (55 minutes) but I'm counting overspill from yesterday as I coded far more than I needed to meet the quota.

Are you taking part in Devember? What are you making? Let me know in the comments.
