title: What I'm learning; 10th April 2017
---

Had a hiatus as the laptop I borrowed really wasn't able to function normally a lot of the time (is turning on too much to ask?) but I now have a lovely new one to code and play with.

Still trying to stick to being project focused.

__Last Week__:

Didn't get around to either of my goals from last week given aforementioned laptop probelms.

__This Week__:

_Learn_:

- es6.io: I know I keep putting this up but now I have a working laptop, no excuses!

_Do_:

- pixels:  a pixel art generator in react and express. I think this will be pretty challenging but it'll be fun to try and build something from the ground up for once that's a play project.

What are you learning this week?
