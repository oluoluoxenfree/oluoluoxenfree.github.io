["Hello World"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is usually the first thing a fledgling coder will type out. "Hello World" is a [string](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and manipulating it was one of the first small accomplishments of my coding journey.

 I'm Olu and I'm currently attempting to become a part of the world of technology and digital. Today, Fluency accepted me to do [Get Digital](http://www.fluency.io/events/get-digital), and in January I'm starting a coding course with [Founders and Coders](http://foundersandcoders.org/). I'm ecstatic that I have the opportunity to show what I can do, and to learn so much from wonderful, talented people.

 My excitement may be confusing. You did a computer science degree of course, how else could you go into coding? Perhaps surprisingly, I did a [philosophy degree at undergraduate level](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/humanities/undergraduate/courses/philosophy/v500_ba_philosophy.page). I think this gives me a unique point of view, poised as I am between the two worlds that use the human mind in similar, yet distinct ways. They are siblings and in no way twins.

 I became interested in technology from quite a young age. I took apart a CD player and an electronic dog I got for Christmas, much to my mother's chagrin. Later, I installed the family dial-up and immediately transfixed by the web. Computers and the internet are as much a part of the fabric of my life as my family and friends. That's rather grandiose but I want to do everything I can to further my knowledge and involvement.

 This raises the question of why I want to be a [full stack web developer](http://edward-designer.com/web/full-stack-web-developer/) in particular. I think being instrumental in the actual building of webpages is something that has been dear to me for a long time. It began when I first used [HTML and CSS](http://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss) to edit a page on a gaming website ([Neopets](http://www.neopets.com/), if you must know). The first time I viewed [source code](http://scratchcomputing.com/articles/whatis_source.html) using an online app that teaches web concepts, called [Skillcrush](http://skillcrush.com/). Astounded by both the seeming complexity and how open the web is, I wanted to do more to make it accessible to anyone who wants to learn.

 At the moment I'm [teaching](http://teamtreehouse.com/) [myself](http://www.codecademy.com/learn) [to](https://www.codeschool.com/) [code](https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-cs50x-introduction-computer-1022). I am also doing the rudiments of [digital marketing](http://www.google.com/onlinechallenge/dmc/), and the [history of the internet](https://www.coursera.org/course/insidetheinternet). I feel out of my depth with the marketing but I did only start it recently. In regards to the coding, [Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0) is my first love but I've been learning [Javascript](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-1) and trying to 'master' [HTML and CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/). That just means I attempt to remember the little idiosyncrasies. I've also cast my eye over [Python](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/). I felt it was best to concentrate on one language at a time, at the advice of several computer science students.

 In any case, even if my dream of becoming a full stack web developer doesn't come true, I'll involve myself in tech in some capacity. I'd love to help to build a website or app from the ground up, but there are countless other roles that are just as instrumental.
